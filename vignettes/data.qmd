# mark-object form
The mark-object form is the main tibble type for the Tukelator app. 

Each row is a mark, and the following columns are needed: 

- `id`: the student ID, 
- `name`: the student name, 
- `course_id`: the course code of the form `DISPLINE-CAT_NO`, 
- `course_name`: course name, 
- `year`: year of offering, 
- `term`: term of offering, in the form of `Sem 1` etc, 
- `mark`: mark (integer), 
- `grade`: grade of mark, and 
- `raa`: RAA code - e.g. UR10. 


```{r}

# Getting the data
To get data into the correct form, we have a collection of functions to parse the various data forms: 

- `parse_peoplesoft()` will convert the downloaded peoplesoft data (See @sec-peoplesoft-download) into a mark-obj tibble. 




## Downloading the Peoplesoft data. {#sec-peoplesoft-download}

1.  Go to [Peoplesoft](https://campus.adelaide.edu.au/psc/cs92prd/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/NUI_FRAMEWORK.PT_LANDINGPAGE.GBL?). Note that you will need to VPN in if you are using this from outside the Uni.
2.  Click on `enrolment`.
